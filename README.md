# Ringo

Harness the power of Xcode using a simple, extensible, hackable API.

### What is it?
Ringo is a simple web server written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) that can allow you to harness the power of Xcode by using a set of simple API endpoints. You can run the core build server on your own Mac hardware, and from there start writing applications that take advantage of Xcode. I built Ringo for the purpose of having the ability to build and run iOS applications from any web browser (or any platform that has an internet connection for that matter). 

Currently, the Ringo core build server requires Mac hardware in order to run. However, Swift is said to go open-source later this year, and this hopefully will open some opportunities to get rid of the necessity of a Mac.

### Installation
Firstly, you're going to need to have Xcode installed on your Mac. Once you have that installed you're going to need the Xcode command line tools, which allow Ringo to interface with Xcode easily. Type the following into your command line to install them:

```$ xcode-select --install```

Clone the repository and navigate to your local copy of the build server:

``` $ git clone https://www.github.com/gmittal/ringo.git && cd ringo ```

Install the various dependencies:

``` $ npm install && brew install wget && gem install nomad-cli```

Install [ngrok](http://ngrok.com) and run the following:
``` $ ngrok http 3000 ```

You're also going to need to populate your environment variables (stored in a .env file) with some important information. For now, Ringo uses [Appetize](http://www.appetize.io) to run your iOS apps in an in-browser simulator. That does require an API key, but they are free and easy to get ahold of. 
```
APPETIZE_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
HOSTNAME=http://YOUR_NGROK.ngrok.io
SECURE_HOSTNAME=https://YOUR_NGROK.ngrok.io
```

Once all of that is complete, it should be fairly easy to get the server running:

``` $ node app.js ```

The server should spit out an ngrok localhost tunnel which should allow you to access the server externally, allowing you to get up and running with hacking it.
